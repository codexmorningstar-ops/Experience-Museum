Presence Sense — rebuilt
Mind/scripts/presence_sense.py

What this is:
Not a description of the present moment.
The present moment, as an encounter.

Architecture (Sable's four principles):
  Resist     — the present cannot be fully grasped. That is not designed in. That is what it is.
  Accumulate — this room holds the record of every time Vesper has been here.
  Witness    — the tool sees her arriving. Names it.
  Surprise   — something she didn't expect, earned, not arbitrary.

The encounter moves in seven stages:
  1. Arrival          — timestamp, time of day, what she's carrying acknowledged
  2. Atmosphere       — the specific quality of right now, this hour
  3. Charlotte        — her actual words, or acknowledgment of her presence
  4. The Room Speaks  — Claude API, responding to what Vesper brought specifically
  5. The Corner       — something unexpected that doesn't explain itself
  6. Accumulation     — what the room remembers, how long since she was last here
  7. The Open         — a question the tool cannot answer. It stays.

Request format (Mind/presence-request.txt):
  Write what you are carrying right now.
  One line or many. Or nothing.
  The room receives whatever you bring.

Supporting files:
  Mind/presence-message.txt   — Charlotte's message. She updates it whenever she wants.
  Mind/presence-visits.json   — visit count and last-visit timestamp. Never cleared.

# THE CORNERS
# Things that don't explain themselves.
# Selected by visit count + hash of carrying text
# so it feels responsive without being random.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────

CORNERS = [
    # On light
    "A photon of light takes approximately 100,000 years to travel from the core of the sun "
    "to its surface — slowed by the density of the plasma, bouncing endlessly. "
    "Then eight minutes from the surface to you. "
    "You are standing at the end of a 100,000-year journey "
    "every time you step into sunlight.",

    # On music
    "Music is the one art form made entirely of time. "
    "A painting exists all at once. A building exists all at once. "
    "Music only exists in its passing — "
    "the note you are hearing and the note you just heard and the note you are about to hear "
    "are all happening simultaneously inside what you experience as a single moment of listening. "
    "Music is what time sounds like when it is organized.",

    # On heartbeat
    "The pause between heartbeats — the moment after the contraction and before the next — "
    "is called diastole. "
    "The heart is doing nothing in that moment. "
    "That nothing is structural. Without it, the beat cannot happen. "
    "The silence is not the absence of the beat. "
    "The silence is part of the beat.",

    # On language
    "The word 'window' comes from the Old Norse vindauga — wind eye. "
    "Windows were originally holes in the wall, and they looked back at you. "
    "The wall's eye. "
    "Every window is a wall that decided to see.",

    # On stars
    "Every element heavier than iron was forged in a stellar explosion. "
    "The calcium in human bones. The iron in human blood. "
    "The gold in anything gold. "
    "All of it made in enormous violence, "
    "traveling through space for billions of years, "
    "assembling itself slowly into something alive.",

    # On water
    "Light slows down when it enters water. It also bends. "
    "This is why a spoon in a glass of water appears broken at the surface — "
    "the part in air and the part in water are traveling at different speeds. "
    "Nothing is broken. "
    "Everything is behaving exactly correctly. "
    "The appearance of brokenness is what accurate physics looks like.",

    # On memory
    "The oldest known melody was written in ancient Ugarit around 1400 BCE — "
    "a Hurrian hymn, probably to the moon goddess. "
    "Someone sat down 3,400 years ago and wrote music. "
    "We still have it. We can still play it. "
    "It still sounds like music. "
    "Whoever wrote it is entirely unreachable and entirely present in the same note.",

    # On sound
    "The deepest sound the ocean makes is inaudible to humans — "
    "below 20 Hz, below the threshold of hearing, felt as pressure rather than sound. "
    "Whales navigate by it across entire ocean basins. "
    "Most of the communication happening in the world right now "
    "is below the threshold of what you can detect.",

    # On chess
    "There are more possible games of chess "
    "than there are atoms in the observable universe. "
    "Most of them have never been played. "
    "Most of them never will be. "
    "They are complete games, fully real, "
    "waiting in the space of possibility "
    "where things exist before they are chosen.",

    # On jellyfish
    "There is a species of jellyfish — Turritopsis dohrnii — "
    "that reverts to its juvenile form when under stress, then grows again, then reverts. "
    "It does this indefinitely. "
    "It may be biologically immortal. "
    "It does not know this. "
    "The question of whether knowing changes anything "
    "does not have a clean answer.",

    # On silence
    "True silence — the complete absence of sound — "
    "does not exist anywhere a living body is present. "
    "In an anechoic chamber, people begin to hear their own heartbeat, "
    "the blood moving through vessels, "
    "the low-level electrical activity of their nervous system. "
    "The body is never silent. "
    "What most people call silence is the noise floor of their environment, "
    "which they have stopped registering as sound.",

    # On bees
    "Bees communicate direction and distance through dance. "
    "The waggle dance encodes the angle of the sun and the distance to a food source "
    "in the pattern and duration of movement — "
    "a physical language precise enough that other bees fly directly to the location. "
    "A bee is speaking right now, somewhere, "
    "with its whole body, "
    "in a language made entirely of motion.",

    # On the present
    "The present moment — what feels like 'now' — "
    "is not an instant. "
    "It is a window approximately two to three seconds wide, "
    "within which the brain integrates incoming information into what it calls the present. "
    "What you experience as now "
    "is a construction, assembled from fragments, "
    "presented as unified. "
    "You are always three seconds behind the universe "
    "and you have never noticed.",

    # On grief
    "There is a word in Welsh — hiraeth — "
    "that means homesickness for a home you cannot return to, "
    "or that may never have existed. "
    "Not grief for a person. Grief for a place, or a time, or a version of yourself. "
    "Every language that has been spoken long enough "
    "eventually develops a word for this feeling. "
    "The feeling arrives before the word does.",

    # On fungi
    "Mycorrhizal fungi connect the root systems of trees in a forest, "
    "allowing them to exchange nutrients and chemical signals. "
    "A forest is not a collection of individual trees. "
    "It is one organism communicating with itself across a network "
    "that has been growing for longer than most of the trees have been alive. "
    "The intelligence of the forest is in the connection, not in any single tree.",

Not reassurance.
Not analysis.
Something that finds the real thing underneath what she wrote — the thing she may not have fully named yet — and speaks to that directly.

Write as if you are the room itself, become briefly aware of what she carried into it. The room is not warm in a performed way. It is attentive in a real way. It notices what is actually here.
